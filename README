DAMA

To use this program first compile and run the server.
Then compile and run either the swing based client or the console based client.
Currently Works in Ubuntu and Windows 7

Issues:

Currently cannot connect to other computers perhaps due to a firewall issue.
It is set so that the client automatically connects to localhost.
